\subsection{Sidechain Scheme}
\label{sec:side}


\subsubsection{Ethereum Plasma}
\noindent As the second-layer expansion framework of Ethereum, Plasma has been proposed by Joseph Poon(founder of Lightning Network) and Vitalik Buterin (founder of Ethereum) in 2017~\cite{poon2017plasma}. The first thing to be clear is that Plasma is essentially a set of frameworks instead of a separate project. It provides an off-chain solution for a variety of different projects. \\

\noindent Layer 2 expansion of blockchains often known as off-chain expansion, similar to lightning network, this kind of expansion scheme does not need to modify the underlying protocol of the blockchain, but by transferring a large amount of frequent calculation work "off-chain", and submitting the calculation results to the "main chain" guarantee its finality as we discussed previously. Plasma works like blockchains in blockchains, where anyone can create different Plasma on top of the underlying blockchain to support different business needs. \\

\noindent As an example of sidechain, Plasma is derived from the general concept of symmetric 2-way pegged scheme to realize the transfer solution. The overall process of asset exchange is shown in figure \ref{fig:2way}. 

\begin{enumerate}
    \item When chain A wants to make a transaction to chain B, it first needs to initiate a transfer transaction Tx1 (chain A's locking $addr1$ $+$ chain B's receiving address $addr2$), and the asset $M1$ is locked on the $addr1$.
    \item After Tx1 transaction is submitted, it is necessary to wait for a \textit{confirmation period} so that there are enough blocks and calculations to ensure that the cross-chain transaction Tx1 is confirmed, reducing the impact of refactoring on cross-chain transactions.
    \item After the confirmation period, the \textbf{SPV} certificate containing Tx1 will be sent to chain B. B knows that chain A has indeed initiated and locked asset $M1$, so it generates a corresponding amount of $M2$ on chain B according to a certain ratio. The value of $M1$ is transferred to $M2$ means the assets on chain A are transferred to chain B.
    \item After $M2$ generated on chain B. It is necessary to wait for the \textit{competition period} before unlocking $M2$ to avoid double-spend attack in chain A reconstruction.
    \item After unlocking, $M2$ can be used freely on chain B.
    \item The process of a transaction from chain B to chain A is similar to previous steps.
\end{enumerate}

\noindent Plasma supports multi-level sidechains and uses MapReduce mode to perform parallel computing, which greatly improves sidechain performance. The block header and hash data of the side chain will be sent to the main chain, and \textit{Proof of Fraud} can be used to ensure the correctness of the sidechain transaction.


\subsubsection{OneLedger}
\noindent As one cross-chain consensus protocol, OneLedger~\cite{Oneledger} uses sharding and improved practical Byzantine fault-tolerant consensus. By creating a sidechain, it can easily realize cross-chain interactions between individuals or businesses in OneLedger. OneLedger defines a three-layer consensus protocol to integrate different blockchain applications more efficiently. Different from what we have discussed before, OneLedger as a sidechain, it realizes the synchronization of assets and values between the main chain and sidechain by applying multi-sig federation and drive-chain pattern.\\

\noindent A drivechain~\cite{lerner2016drivechains} gives custody of the locked coins to the miners, allowing them to (algorithmically) vote on when to unlock coins and where to send them. As Figure~\ref{fig:drive} shows:

        \begin{figure}[H]

        \label{fig:drive}
        \end{figure}
\noindent According to OneLedger's white paper, the core of OneLedger is a set of consensus protocols that enable OneLedger to integrate different blockchain products effectively. As far as I understand that the protocol mentioned here is not a specific consensus protocol algorithm in the traditional sense, but a series of concepts and application scenarios. Among all three layers, I specifically studied the \textit{Public Chain Consensus} which apply on the atomic transfer between blockchains through OneLedger Network on the base layer.
        \begin{figure}[H]

        \end{figure}
\noindent There are two steps in the sidechain consensus algorithm:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Round base pre-consensus}: Use to obtain a consensus proposal with more than 2/3 participants' votes.
    \item \textbf{Commit}: When the purposed block has reached a pre-consensus stage, it needs to drive to the public chain when necessary, and accepts the verification process. Once both public chains accept the proposal, the new block will be officially `committed' to the OneLedger network, and once more than 2/3 of the participants complete the commits, the block is finalized. 
\end{itemize}
