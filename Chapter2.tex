\noindent This chapter gives a concept background towards cross-chain technology in Section~\ref{sec:back}, characterizes the specific manifestation of cross-chain projects in Section~\ref{sec:cm}, and addresses the cross-chain realization difficulties into 5 parts in Section~\ref{sec:diff}.

\section{Background}
\label{sec:back}
\subsection{What is cross-ledger?}
\noindent With the development of blockchain technology, many different chains have been born, and the information isolation of many chains inevitably restraint  the circulation of value in blockchain systems. It turned out that there is a need for a technology that can work with different blockchains and become the bridge connecting them. \\

\noindent Cross-ledger (or cross-chain), in the narrow sense, is the process of asset/data interoperability between two relative independent blockchains.\\

\noindent Traditional ICT field defines the \textbf{interoperability} as the ability to share and utilize information between different ICT systems or modules in a reliable way~\cite{osello2015bim}. While \textit{Vitalik Buterin} mentioned in Chain Interoperability~\cite{buterin2016chain} that interoperability in the blockchain area mainly describes the ability of assets exchange, information intercommunication, and atomic transactions between various blockchains. The blockchain interoperability can be achieved by introducing the third party without modifying the original chains.

\subsection{Evolution of Cross-chain}
\noindent As shown in Figure~\ref{fig:his}, it has not been a short period for Ripple to release the \textbf{Interledger Protocol}(ILP)~\cite{thomas2015protocol} in 2012 since the advent of Bitcoin Network in 2009. Interledger protocol proposed a cross-ledger interoperability scheme for the first time in the blockchain area, which enables cross-ledger transfers through third-party notaries. In 2014, the BlockStream team, founded by the Bitcoin core developer group, first proposed a \textbf{Pegged Sidechains} cross-chain interaction scheme, introducing a sidechain with a two-way peg to achieve cross-chain asset transfer. Soon in 2015, the Bitcoin Lightning Network~\cite{poon2016bitcoin} adopted a \textbf{Hashed Timelock} mechanism to implement a fast transaction channel off the Bitcoin main chain. In 2016, the BTC-Relay~\cite{btc-relay} solution was released, and the one-way cross-chain communication from Bitcoin to Ethereum was realized based on the \textbf{relay cross-chain scheme}. In the same year, Vitalik Buterin made a comprehensive and in-depth analysis of blockchain interoperability issues. In 2017, Polkadot~\cite{polkadot} and Cosmos~\cite{cosmos} first proposed a solution for building a cross-chain network infrastructure platform. Now the Cosmos hub blockchain has launched in March 2019.

\section{Cross-chain manifestation}
\label{sec:cm}
\noindent So far we know, current public blockchain is a self-adaptive, relatively closed distributed system. Although the system allows new nodes to join and old nodes exit, it is still hard to be compatible with external systems because of   its fault-tolerant mechanism. \\

\noindent In a way, there are two main value/data interoperability implementations between chains:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Inter-chain asset exchange}: \\
    It usually refers to asset swapping between different users on both chains. However, the total amount of assets in each chain does not increase or decrease. Instead, the ownership of the assets has changed. The process of this change needs to occur synchronously on both chains. \\
    \begin{figure}[H]
    \includegraphics[width=1\textwidth]{./figures/asset_swap.png}
    \centering
    \caption{Inter-chain exchange diagram}%\protect\footnotemark}
    \centering
    \label{fig:swap}
    \end{figure}
    
    This diagram briefly describes the situation when Alice wants to use $X$ amount of chain M's tokens to exchange for Bob's $Y$ amount of chain N's token. Eventually, Bob's token in chain N swaps to Alice's address in chain N. Similarly, Alice's token swaps to Bob's address located in chain M.
    \item \textbf{Inter-chain asset transfer (one/two-way)}: \\
    Compared with the consistency in the total assets number of asset exchange, the transfer has a change of asset value, which is manifested in the increase or decrease of the available assets in each chain. For example in Figure \ref{fig:transfer}, the scenario is Alice wants to transfer $X$ number of tokens from chain M to chain N. As a result, chain M send $X$ amount of token to a locked address in original chain, in turn, chain N generates an equal amount of tokens of itself in a certain address for future uses. Thus, the transfer of this asset succeed.

    \end{figure}
\end{enumerate}


\noindent For now, researches and applications of cross-chain are mainly focused on these two manifestations. Some projects have proposed the concept of cross-chain smart contracts, which is similar to the realization of cross-chain asset transfer in terms of technical implementation.
