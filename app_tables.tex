\hline
Fusion&	Fusion supports multi-platform cross-chain asset transfer, using a distributed signature notary model for cross-chain transaction processing.&	Notary& 	HHCM&	Plat-form&	N-c-N	&Transactional& 	No \\
\hline
Chainlink&	The ChainLink project was launched in 2014 to address an important issue of blockchain interaction with external data by creating a secure link to link real-world data to blockchain systems.&	Notary&	N/A&	Prot-col&	N-N	&Most situation&	Yes\\
\hline
ArcBlock&	ArcBlock is a platform dedicated to the development and deployment of decentralized blockchain applications using the Open Chain Access Protocol to realize the cross-chain ability of most applications.&	Relay&	PoS&	Plat-form	&N-c-N&	DApps&	No \\
\hline
Pallet-One&	It is a high-performance distributed cross-chain protoco, and has become the IP protocol of the blockchain world. By unifying the interface of each blockchain, it provides a multi-language smart contract running environment, uses randomly elected jurors to manage multi-signed public keys.& 	Notary&	DPoS+ Jury& 	Prot-col&	N-N	&Most situation	&No \\
\hline
Quant Over-ledger&	Quant Network creates the Overledger system that operates on top of blockchains, providing the interface for enabling the interoperability between blockchain and traditional network. It provides unlimited possibilities for blockchain data and applications.&	Relay&	Protocol based&	Plat-form&	N-N&	DApps&	Yes\\
\hline
Plasma&	Plasma is a side chain design model of Ethereum. Its main idea is to provide a model that can perform cross-chain transactions, and rely on the Ethereum blockchain to ensure its safety. The MapReduce mode is used to perform parallel computing, which greatly improves the performance of the sidechain.&	Side-chain&	PoS&	Layer 2& 	1-1&	Smart contract framework&	No \\

\noindent The comparison table below summarizes 20 state-of-art cross-chain solutions, varying from protocols to platforms. The level of blockchain interoperability\footnotemark[1] is defined by Overledger develop team, using the following notation:
\begin{itemize}
    \item 1-c-1: Two connected blockchains per time with a connector;
    \item N-c-N: Many connected blockchains per time with connectors;
    \item 1-1: Two connected blockchain connected per time without a connector;
    \item N-N: Many connected blockchains per time without connectors.
\end{itemize}
