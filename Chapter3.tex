\chapter{Projects Classification} 
\label{chap:3}
\noindent Chapter~\ref{chap:3} presents the corresponding solutions in Section~\ref{sec:sol} based on the difficulties mentioned in Chapter~\ref{chap:2}. Followed by the case study of eight well-known cross-chain projects in cross-chain industry in Section~\ref{sec:ps}. By illustrating the working theory and new terms that purposed,  we will be familiar with the scheme categories defined by Section~\ref{sec:sol}.

\section{Project study}
\label{sec:ps}
\noindent Given the solutions discussed above, we are ready to investigate the popular projects that adopts these solutions.

\subsection{Lightning Network}
\noindent In general, we could not say lighting network realize the cross-chain function, though it provides with a typical application towards atomic swaps and HTLC. The design idea of the lightning network is straightforward. It put a large number of high-frequency small-value transactions off-chain to expand the transaction processing capability of the blockchain.\\
\noindent Lightning network\cite{poon2016bitcoin} is a fast and scalable Bitcoin transaction project, and it has two main technical points:
\begin{enumerate}[A.]
    \item \textbf{Recoverable Sequence Maturity Contract} 
    
    	RSMC is similar to a reserve mechanism in which both parties trade in an
    	off-chain trading pool. This trading pool is a "micro-payment channel".
    	When a transaction occurs between two parties, the proportion share of the
    	common assets in the trading pool will change. The new proportional data
    	needs to be signed and confirmed by both parties, and the old version is invalid. The entire process is completed off the chain,
    	so it does not occupy the resources of the main chain. The final
    	proportion of assets will be confirmed, and record to the main-chain after
    	one of the transaction party requires a withdraw.
    	
    	It could happen anytime as long as both parties signed for this. To ensure
    	the security, if someone submitted the old share of assets to make
    	profits, others could protect themselves by proving this balance sheet is
    	not the latest one. Then the asset of the counterfeit party will be
    	confiscated to the challenger.
    \item \textbf{Hash Time-locked Contract}
    
     Lightning Network uses HTLC to guarantee the atomicity of transaction, as
     shown in Figure \ref{fig:hash}. 
     
     This diagram illustrates how HTLC works to
     provide limited-time transfer function. The basic process is: Bob and Alice
     can reach an agreement that specifies Alice to lock a certain amount of
     assets and provide a hashed value of $H$. Before the arrival of time $T$, if
     Bob can learn an appropriate $s$ (secret) where it's hash value matches with
     $H$ and sent to Alice, Bob can get the corresponding amount of assets value.
     Conversely, the asset will unlock and return to Alice.
\end{enumerate}
\noindent When there are "micro-payment channels" between multiple users, these channels are connected to form a "channel network", which is the lightning network. The mutual transfer of the two parties does not require a direct payment channel to connect with, through the intermediary can also achieve mutual transfer. \\ \\
%\noindent \begin{large}
%\textbf{Disadvantages}:
%\end{large}
%\begin{itemize}
%    \item Users cannot pay off-line. 
%    \item More suitable for small transactions. Large transfer amount needs to open multiple channels.
%    \item Easy to face the dis-matched situation, if there's no response from one party, the other one may need hours to close the channel and substitute with another route.
%\end{itemize}

\section{Summary}
\noindent This Chapter has presented a thorough case study of 8 representative cross-chain projects and classified them into several working schemes. Through the official white paper and other documents, the preceding sections explained the working process and theory of them using diagrams to help the understanding. Including some comments and thoughts towards them. The total work of comparison will be shown as a table in \nameref{app:A}.
